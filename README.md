# APIs

## Authentication API here

OAuth - Google Library key. 

When you log in you can either login with your Google account connected to your gmail or you can create a new account with just the email and password.


#  Environment Variables

In order for the app to function correctly, the user must set up their own environment variables. There should be a .env file containing the following:


    REACT_APP_apiKey= ""
    REACT_APP_authDomain=synaps-5ce5c.firebaseapp.com
    REACT_APP_databaseURL=https://synaps-5ce5c.firebaseio.com

    REACT_APP_messagingSenderId= ""
    REACT_APP_appId=1:""
    REACT_APP_ipinfoKey=""

    REACT_APP_BASE_URL=https://staging-lambda-synaps-be.herokuapp.com/

                            |

# Testing

- Supertest
- React Library
- Jest-DOM

#  Installation Instructions

npx create-react-app

BackEnd
node install

## Other Scripts

    * build - creates a build of the application
    * start - starts the production server after a build is created
    * test - runs tests in **tests** directory \* eject - copy the configuration files and dependencies into the project so you have full control over them

#### Pull Request Guidelines

- Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a build.
- Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, including new plist variables, exposed ports, useful file locations and container parameters.
- Ensure that your code conforms to our existing code conventions and test coverage.
- Include the relevant issue number, if applicable.
- You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of two other developers, or if you do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you.

## Documentation

See [Backend Documentation](https://github.com/Lambda-School-Labs/pt-synaps-be/blob/master/README.md) for details on the backend of our project.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More
